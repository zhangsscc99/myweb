            Here are the top three scalable technologies to combat food insecurity, according to Ruff.

            Upcycling
            According to the Food Waste Index Report produced by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2021), food waste from households, retail establishments and the food service industry totals 931 million tonnes or an average of 74 kg per capita each year. More than half of this wastage occurs at the household level, but 26% comes from food service and 13% from retail, which means that there are production measures that can be put in place to significantly mitigate food losses. One of the most impactful measures to reduce food waste is upcycling, or the act of procuring and processing ingredients that otherwise would not have been consumed.

            Plant-based and cellular protein.
In 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projected that the global demand for meat would reach 455 million metric tons by 2050, up 76% from 2005. This is highly problematic given that industrial animal farming inflicts negative externalities on public health, animal welfare and the environment, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions, unsustainable land use and biodiversity loss, and unsustainable water use.
